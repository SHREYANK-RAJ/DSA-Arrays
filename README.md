# Core DSA Practice 

This repository contains my **C++ implementations** of basic Data Structures and Algorithms problems.  
I started with **arrays** to build a strong foundation before moving into advanced topics.  

---

## Problems Implemented

- `arrayIntro.cpp` → basic usage of arrays in C++
- `arrayScope.cpp` → difference between local vs static arrays
- `linearSearch.cpp` → simple search for an element
- `maxMin.cpp` → finding maximum and minimum element
- `reverse.cpp` → reverse an array in-place
- `duplicate_in_array.cpp` → detect duplicate values
- `find_unique.cpp` → find the element that occurs only once
- `intersection_of_two_arrays.cpp` → common elements between two arrays
- `pair_sum.cpp` → check if any two numbers add up to target
- `swap_alternates.cpp` → swap every alternate pair

## What I Learned

- Arrays are fixed size but powerful for practicing problem-solving.
- **Linear search** is easy to code, but we’ll need faster techniques later.
- Reversing an array with **two pointers** is more efficient than using extra space.
- Hash-based approaches (`unordered_set`, `unordered_map`) make problems like  
  *pair sum, duplicates, unique element* much faster (O(n) vs O(n²)).
- Static vs local arrays helped me understand **scope and memory lifetime**.

## Language

- All codes are written in **C++**.
- Compiled & tested using **g++** on macOS (works on any standard compiler).

---

## Next Steps

- Move to **sorting problems** and then to **searching (binary search)**.
- Keep adding more problems from Love Babbar’s DSA Sheet and LeetCode.

This repo is part of my personal learning journey. I’ll keep updating it as I progress.
